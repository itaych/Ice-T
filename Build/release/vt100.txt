                   VT100 Commands
     as implemented in Ice-T Terminal Emulator v2.7x
                   by Itay Chamiel

Based on list from Omnicom's documentation, by David Young.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Conventions used:

Esc    - the ASCII character 27
^      - Control.
spaces - shown only for clarity. They are not part of the commands.
__     - Decimal number from 0 to 255 (can be any number of digits: 001, 01, 1
are the same).

"Can scroll" means that if the cursor cannot move up or down without passing
the scrolling limits (not necessarily the top or bottom of the screen), it
will not move, and cause a scroll to occur.
If the scrolling margin is not the same as the screen limit, and the cursor
is at the top or bottom of the screen, "can scroll" commands will NOT cause a
scroll. A scroll occurs ONLY at scroll margins.

The VT100 commands are case-sensitive. C is not the same as c.

Commands with parameters look like this:
Esc [ __ ; __ ; __ ; ....... ; __ x (where x is a different letter for each
command). Ice-T allows up to 255 numbers to be received in one command,  but
most commands will only be affected by the first one or two values.
All such commands have defaults which are used if no parameters are
received, or if less are received than expected.

Unknown control characters, unknown "Esc x" commands and unknown
"Esc [ __ ; ... ; __ x" commands are silently ignored by the emulator.

Line and column numbers start at 1.

Control characters
------------------
^E  Send "Answerback" response, 4 characters (*): Ctrl-P + Ctrl-P 0
^G  Bell, flash border color.
^H  Cursor left one character. No effect if cursor on col 1
^I  Tab. Cursor moves to next tabstop, or to column 80 if no further tabs.
    Default tabstops are at columns 9, 17, 25, and so on, spaced 8 apart.
^J  Linefeed, move cursor down one line. Move cursor to col 1 ONLY if newline
    mode is SET (see Esc [ __ h). Can scroll.
^K  Same as ^J
^L  Formfeed, treated as Linefeed (^J)
^M  Carriage-Return, move cursor to col 1
^N  Invoke G1 character set (see "Esc )" commands)
^O  Invoke G0 character set (see "Esc (" commands)
^X or ^Y  Abort any Esc sequence currently in progress. If a sequence was in progress
    and ^X or ^Y were sent, the checkerboard character is displayed to inform
    of an error. If not - the code is ignored.
^X B00 - Begin a Zmodem session. This is the beginning of the ZRQINIT frame.
^[  Escape. Begins a new Escape-sequence, cancelling any other which may have
    been in progress. (^[ is 27 or Esc.)

(*) This answerback string is the one Telix (PC comm. program) returns.
    I believe it is used for Compuserve transfers, and that it ought to be
    configurable by the user.

Esc x Codes
-----------
Esc c  Reset terminal settings, clear screen, home cursor.
Esc D  Cursor down 1 line, can scroll.
Esc E  Cursor down one line and moves to col 1, can scroll.
Esc H  Set tab at current cursor horizontal position.
Esc M  Cursor up 1 line, can scroll
Esc Z  Identify Terminal. Software replies by sending response Esc [?1;0c
Esc 7  Save cursor position, graphic rendition, character set, wrap mode.
Esc 8  Restore parameters saved with Esc 7
Esc >  Keypad NumLock On
Esc =  Keypad NumLock Off

Esc [ __ x commands
-------------------
These commands are also recognized if they do not receive any parameter
(Esc [ x), or if they receive less than the required amount of parameters.
In these cases, the default(s) replace the required number.

Esc [ __ A  (none/0 --> 1) Cursor up __ lines, does not scroll, stops at edge
          of screen
Esc [ __ B  Down, same as above
Esc [ __ C  Forward, same as above, cursor stays on same line
Esc [ __ D  Backward, same as above
Esc [ __ ; __ H  (none/0 --> 1,1) Set cursor to row, col. If any parameter is
          not within range (80 for x or 24 for y) they are truncated to 80
          or 24. 0 is converted to 1.
Esc [ __ J  (none --> 0) Erase part of the screen:
          0 - cursor position to end of line (inclusive) and all lines below
          1 - cursor position to start of line (inclusive) and all lines above
          2 - entire screen. cursor does not move. (ANSI-BBS: home cursor)
          Other - ignore command
Esc [ __ K  (none --> 0) Erase part of line:
          0 - cursor position to end of line (inclusive)
          1 - cursor position to start of line (inclusive)
          2 - entire line
          Other - ignore command
Esc [ __ c  (Parameter ignored) Device attributes. Returns Esc [?1;0c
Esc [ __ ; __ f  (none --> 1,1) same as Esc[_;_H (above)
Esc [ __ g  (none --> 0)
          0 - Clear tab at cursor column
          3 - Clear all tabs.
          Other - ignore command
Esc [ __ h  (20 only accepted) 20 - Set newline mode
          Receiving an lf will be treated as cr + lf
          Pressing Return on keyboard sends cr + lf
          Not 20 - ignore command.
Esc [ __ l (20 only accepted) opposite of above, Reset newline mode
          lf = lf alone
          return sends lf alone
          Not 20 - ignore command.
Esc [ ? __ h  Set mode, see below
Esc [ ? __ l  Reset mode, see below
Parameter          Set           Reset
 1 - cursor keys   Application   Numeric
 3 - columns       clear screen in both cases
 5 - screen color  Reverse-vid   Normal
 7 - autowrap      On            Off
Esc [ __ ; ... ; __ m  (at least one parameter, none --> 0)
 Select graphic rendition:
 0 - Normal      5 - Blink
 4 - Underline   7 - Reverse video   8 - Invisible (writes blank spaces)
Esc [ __ n  (none --> 5)
            Device Status Report. Response depends on parameter:
            5: response is "ready" - Esc [0n
            6: report cursor position - Esc [ row ; col R
Esc [ __ ; __ r (defaults: 1,24) Set top and bottom scrolling margins.
            1 and 24, for example, mean the entire screen scrolls.
            14 and 24 cause the last 10 lines to scroll. 14,24 mean lines
            14 to 24 INCLUSIVE.
Esc [ __ s (Parameter ignored) Same as Esc 7
Esc [ __ u (Parameter ignored) Same as Esc 8

Other Escape sequences
----------------------
Esc ( A or Esc ( B             Set G0 to point to ASCII characters
Esc ( 0 or Esc ( 1 or Esc ( 2  Set G0 to point to line-drawing graphics
Esc ) A or Esc ) B             Set G1 to point to ASCII characters
Esc ) 0 or Esc ) 1 or Esc ) 2  Set G1 to point to line-drawing graphics

Esc # 3 Double-Height, top half
Esc # 4 Double-Height, bottom half
Esc # 5 Normal size
Esc # 6 Double-width
Esc # 7 Normal size
Esc # 8 Fill screen with the letter E for screen adjustment (useless, but
        was too easy to implement)

The line-changing commands preserve anything already on that line, unless
an 80-column line is changed into a 40-column line. In that case, the
last 40 characters of that line are lost.
Double-size characters use the standard built-in character set (since it's
40 columns) plus a few characters like tilde and curly braces, and for the
special graphics characters, which don't exist in ATASCII, a simple routine
which doubles the 80-column characters is used.
Double-height characters are the same as double-width, but each line of pixels
is duplicated to achieve double height.
