Ice-T Quickstart guide
----------------------
Real men and real women use real hardware. Many of you however probably just
want to get this running on your emulator with minimal hassle, so here is a
quick start guide for users of the Altirra emulator under Windows.

I assume you have a copy of Altirra (tested version was 2.30) and real Atari
XL ROM files.
In Altirra make the following settings under the System menu:
Hardware > 65XE / 130XE.
Firmware > 600XL / 800XL.
Firmware > BASIC *not* checked.
Memory Size > 128K (130XE).
Video > No Artifacting.
R-Time8 > checked.
Serial Ports > Enable serial port emulation. Select 850 Interface Module.
     Emulate Telnet Protocol. Allow outbound connections.

Drag the icet.xex file icon onto the Altirra window. Ice-T should load
correctly. At the title screen press Enter twice to enter terminal mode.

At this point you should be able to type:

atdI <hostname> <port>

to establish a Telnet connection to any Internet host. Note that the 'I' must
be in upper case, and that port 23 is the standard for Telnet. Try one of these:

atdI irc.atarichat.net 800     (an IRC chat gateway)
atdI www.atarinews.org 23      (the Atarinews.Org BBS. user: bbs, pw: bbs)

Option and Select (F4/F3) can be used to scroll back through your history.
Press Ctrl-1 to pause if text is scrolling too fast.
You can close a connection with Ctrl-Shift-H (Hangup).
Access the main menu with Shift-Esc.

Note that since you've booted Ice-T without DOS, disk functionality will be
unavailable so you can't save your settings or do any file operations. Boot
from the disk image instead if you need that.

Enjoy :)
