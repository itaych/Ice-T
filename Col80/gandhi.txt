Gandhi.›This man was educated in Britain as a lawyer,but when W.W.I. began he went back to India.›Gandhi was a very simple man and had a self sacrificing life,and didn't think of himself,and followed the Hindu faith››Many people in India began to look up to him as the "holy man".››Since Gandhi believed in "nonviolent resistance" his weapens against the British were strikes,fasts,and protest marches.››Not all Indians believed in nonviolent resistance,but in 1919,there was a wave of killing people and looting.›This led to the fact that British soldiers got into a city called Amritsar,and shot unarmd people,and about 400 dide,and 12,000 were wounded.›this 400 encloded men,women,and children.›As a result Gahndi and his followers were shocked,and became determind to win a complete freedom of India.››Some times between 1920s and 1930s,Gandhi made campaigns of nonviolent resistance against the British,as a result, he was send several times to jail.››Douring the 1930s,British met with some Indian leaders,to begin prepearing self government for India.›then in 1935 the British passed a law that gave the India self-government.››The Muslems also got together because they where afraid that when the British will give them the independence,  they wouldn't be treated well by the people of the Hindu religion,  which are more than them,  and as a result the muslems wanted to get a country of its own.››In the beginning of the 1942 Jappanise army got untill the border of India,  Britain promised to give India independence when the war will end.››Also when Gandhi was about to open one of the preyers,  He was shot by a hindu follower and dide.   After his deth,  there was only one good thing and that is,  that the Indians where full of shame,  and the murders and the lottings and all these sord of things decreased.››At the end of the war all the prisiners where released,  and the Congress started making plans of self government for India.   The Muslems wanted a country of their own,  and the Congress refused to devide India.

And in August 1947 two countries got their independence,  which are:India,  with most areas of the Hindu religion,  and Pakistan,which has the most areas of the Muslems.   Because of the consentrate of the Muslems in the two areas of the land,  which where thousants of miles away.    Pkistan was devided into two countries which are East Pakistan and West Pakistan.››In January 1950 India was a republic country,  which had a president named      Nehero,  untill his deth which was in 1967.››››
