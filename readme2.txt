Welcome to Ice-T!!

In order to read the doc file, load
the program COL80.COM. At the prompt
type in ICET.DOC. This file reader
is not a complete program, and still
dies sometimes.. Don't try using up
movements near the top of the file
or just after a disk load, just to
stay on the safe side.

While viewing the file you may hit
space to page down, I to invert the
screen colors, or Shift-? for help
on all keys available.
