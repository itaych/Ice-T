vt.fnt - Standard ASCII character set, plus graphics characters and a few extras needed for the terminal emulation.

vtibm.fnt - characters 128-255 as found on a standard IBM-PC compatible - needed for ANSI-BBS, which uses many of the
		graphics characters.

vtheb1.fnt - same as vtibm.fnt, but with square Hebrew characters from 0-26 (128-154). This overwrites most
		international characters.

vtheb2.fnt - same as vtheb1.fnt, but with handwritten-style Hebrew characters.

vtheb2d.fnt - same as vtheb2.fnt, but with the Hebrew letters duplicated at 96-122 (224-250). This overwrites the
		Greek character set.

(The vtheb2d.fnt file shipped with 2.72, which was the current version for 15 years. No one complained.)
