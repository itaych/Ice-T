1. proper detection of online status?
2. Flow control can cause visual bugs or crashes, especially when entering dial menu.

move DLI code into VBI1 and disable DLI. (done)
read RT8 less often (after 59 frames, read every frame until change seen) (done)
move non essential (clock) code from VBI1 to VBI2. maybe use clock_update as flag. increment it rather than set to 1. (done)
arrange memory. perhaps move title screen texts into banked area. (done)
colors (done)
fine scroll will ruin DLI markers. must restore when leaving fscrol mode. (done)
improve code efficiency. jump tables (done)
colors not blanked when redrawing line during resize (done)
colors not blanked when erasing lines or partial screen clears (done)
use "H:" if no "D:" (done)
seol stuff in vt2.asm (done)
reset term when hanging up and dialing (done)
VT52 emulation plus keypad and arrows, not including graphics characters (done)
VT102 and ANSI-BBS emulation (done)

handle_insert_delete_char (done)
checkerboard character (^X) is broken in dbl width mode. (done)
graphics chars screw up when switching line to double width. (done)

file xfers:
	x/ymodem failed due to close3 (done)
	ymodem-g sent redundant ACKs (done)
	zmodem sent redundant XON (done)
	x/ymodem: is only 15K of 16K buffer being used? (done)
	ymodem-g: doesn't work on real atari (probably wontfix)
	vt3: see "todo" and figure it out. (done)
	zmodem: why do we request buffer size 3fff and not 4000? (prob. done but check deeper when reviewing code)
	zmodem: why don't we send a challenge?
	zmodem: (linux) why does linux version overflow? maybe need to be changed to not send break (mode 1). do we send a break today?
	xmodem upload: consider uncommenting. (altirra will break it though - can't send 0xff!)
	NOTES: in Altirra "raw" mode, emulated Atari can receive any character, but cannot send 0xFF.
			Altirra "telnet" can't do any file transfer except Zmodem of plain text files.
	Altirra telnet doesn't identify as any terminal type.
	Altirra also has broken printer driver. (fixed in 2.40)

colors:
	spaces should generate colors if background color is set. add flag bit to 'boldface' variable. see ptxreg.
		however space should always bold/unbold if overwriting an existing char!
		that should fix emacs tetris.
	colors are ugly if screen is inverse. perhaps have dual color table, one for regular one for inverse.
	maybe do black text by enabling inverse video. Then background color takes priority.
private extensions:
	NOTE: Esc Q or Esc R are 'private' unused codes.
	- Esc Qi M   enable bold without setting color. Any use of Esc [ _ m disables.
	- Esc Qi n1;c1;c2;c3;c4;c5 [;n2;c1;c2;c3;c4;c5].. C   set all 5 colors for horizontal lines. 255/absent = no change.
	- Esc Qi _ L   set(1)/unset(0 or blank) scroll lock for color background.
	- Esq Qi _ S/T    force scroll down/up color table by _ lines.
	
gen new icet.dat for release

known issues:
double width does not support 8-bit chars.
some characters (tilde/grave accent/curly brackets) misbehave when switching line width.
areas containing nothing but the checkerboard character may be considered blank by insert/delete char routines.
